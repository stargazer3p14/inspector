You (either an individual or a single entity) are not required to sign or somehow acknowledge your use of Inspector. However

Any product or software package including Inspector or part of it must include such notice.

	3. DISTRIBUTION WITH DIFFERENT TERMS. Inspector may be distributed, leased or rented under different terms than
defined by this license provided that:
	 a) you (distributor) acquired your copy in compliance to this license
	 b) your license is not less restrictive than this one, i.e. it doesn't allow anything prohibited by this license
	 c) if your license allows further redistribution it must enforce inclusion of acknowledgement notice (2) in all
distributions.

	4. TERMS OF USE. Inspector's intended purpose is to assist in development, debugging and testing software for DOS and
